# **Gitflow Strategy in Detail**

Gitflow is a popular branching strategy for managing the development of a codebase using Git. It was developed by **`Vincent Driessen`** and is based on the principles of keeping the **`main`** branch in a releasable state while allowing for ongoing development on the **`develop`** branch.

## **Main Branches**

- **`main`**: The **`main`** branch is the production-ready branch. It should only be updated with releases and should always contain the latest stable version of the codebase.
- **`develop`**: The **`develop`** branch is used for ongoing development. It is where feature branches are merged and used for testing and integration.
- **`staging`**: The **`staging`** branch is used for testing and integration before releasing to production. It should be created from the **`develop`** branch, and once the codebase is ready for release, it should be merged into the **`main`** branch.

## **Supporting Branches**

- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches are used for developing new features. They should be created from the **`develop`** branch and, once the feature is complete, should be merged back into the **`develop`** branch.
- **`release`**: Release branches are used for preparing a release. They should be created from the **`develop`** branch and, once the release is complete, should be merged back into the **`main`** and **`develop`** branches.
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bugfix branches are used for fixing bugs. They should be created from the **`develop`** branch and, once the fix is complete, should be merged back into the **`develop`** branch.
- **`hotfix/*`**: Hotfix branches are used for making urgent bug fixes. They should be created from the **`main`** branch and, once the fix is complete, should be merged back into the **`main`** and **`develop`** branches.

## **Workflow**

1. Create a new feature branch from the **`develop`** branch.
2. Develop the new feature on the feature branch.
3. Once the feature is complete, merge it into the **`develop`** branch.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for any additional features.
5. When ready to release, create a new release branch from the **`develop`** branch.
6. Test and make any final adjustments on the release branch.
7. Once the release is ready, merge it into the **`staging`** branch for further testing and integration.
8. Once the codebase is ready for release, merge it into the **`main`** branch and tag it with a release number.
9. Finally, merge the release into the **`develop`** branch.

## **Advantages of using Gitflow**

- Keeps the **`main`** branch in a releasable state: By only merging completed features into the **`main`** branch, it is always in a state where it can be released.
- Allows for ongoing development: The **`develop`** branch allows for ongoing development without interfering with the **`main`** branch.
- Encourages collaboration: By creating feature branches for each new feature, multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- Provides a clear workflow: The Gitflow workflow provides a clear and structured approach to managing the development of a codebase.
- The `staging` branch provides an additional layer of testing and integration before releasing it to production.

## **Conclusion**

Gitflow is a powerful and popular branching strategy for managing the development of a codebase

## **Conclusion**

Gitflow is a powerful and popular branching strategy for managing the development of a codebase using Git. It provides a clear and structured approach to managing the development of a codebase while keeping the `main` branch in a releasable state. By following the Gitflow workflow, teams can collaborate more efficiently and make sure that their codebase is always in a releasable state.
