# **Most Commonly Used Git Commands with Real-world Examples**

Git is a powerful tool for managing code and collaborating with others, but it can be tricky to navigate. In this guide, we'll discuss some of the most commonly used Git commands and provide real-world examples to help you understand how they can be used.

## **git init**

The **`git init`** command is used to initialize a new Git repository. This command creates a new directory called **`.git`** in the current directory, which contains all the necessary files for Git to track the changes in the repository.

Example:

```bash
git init
```

## **git clone**

The **`git clone`** command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository. This command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository, and clones all the files and the entire commit history to the local machine.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

In this example, the command will clone the remote repository located at **[https://github.com/user/repo.git](https://github.com/user/repo.git)** to the local machine.

## **git add**

The **`git add`** command is used to stage changes for a commit. This command adds the specified file or directory to the staging area, where it can be committed.

Example:

```bash
git add index.html
```

In this example, the **`index.html`** file is added to the staging area, and will be included in the next commit.

## **git commit**

The **`git commit`** command is used to save changes to the repository. This command creates a new commit with a specified message, which describes the changes made in the commit.

Example:

```
git commit -m "added new feature"
```

In this example, a new commit is created with the message "added new feature", which describes the changes made in the commit.

## **git push**

The **`git push`** command is used to upload local commits to a remote repository. This command sends the commits to the specified remote repository and branch.

Example:

```bash
git push origin development
```

In this example, the local commits are pushed to the remote repository **`origin`** and the branch **`development`**.

## **git pull**

The **`git pull`** command is used to download changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository. This command retrieves the changes from the specified remote repository and branch and merges them into the current branch.

Example:

```bash
git pull origin development
```

In this example, the changes from the remote repository **`origin`** and branch **`development`** are pulled and merged into the current local branch.

## **git branch**

The **`git branch`** command is used to list, create, or delete branches. This command can be used to see a list of the current branches in the repository, create a new branch, or delete an existing branch.

Example:

```bash
git branch
```

In this example, the command will list all the branches in the repository.

Example:

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

In this example, the command will create a new branch called **`new-feature`**.

Example:

```bash
git branch -d old-feature
```

In this example, the command will delete the branch called **`old-feature`**.

## **git merge**

The **`git merge`** command is used to combine changes from multiple branches into a single branch. This command merges the specified branch into the current branch and creates a new commit that contains all the changes from both branches.

Example:

```
git checkout development
git merge feature-branch
```

In this example, the **`feature-branch`** is being merged into the **`development`** branch. A new commit is created that contains all the changes from both branches and the **`development`** branch pointer is moved to this new commit.

## **git status**

The **`git status`** command is used to check the current status of the repository. This command shows the current branch, the files that have been modified, and the files that have been added to the staging area but not yet committed.

Example:

```bash
git status
```

In this example, the command will show the current branch, the files that have been modified and the files that are in the staging area but not yet committed.

By understanding and using these commonly used git commands, you can better navigate and manage your code changes and collaborate with your team efficiently.

## **Conclusion**

These are some of the most commonly used Git commands that will help you navigate and manage your code changes with Git. It is important to remember that Git is a complex tool and there are many other commands and options available. Keep in mind to always check the documentation and help pages for each command to better understand how to use it and how it can be helpful.
