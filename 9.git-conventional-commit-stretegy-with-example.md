# **Git Conventional Commit Strategy with Examples**

Conventional commits are a structured way of writing commit messages that makes it easy to understand the history of a codebase and automate certain tasks such as versioning and changelog generation.

The conventional commit strategy follows a specific format for commit messages, making it easier to understand the intent of each commit and the changes made. The format consists of a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**, separated by a colon (:).

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Here is a list of some of the most common types:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code formatting or style changes
- **refactor**: Refactoring of existing code
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:

```bash
feat(login-page): added input validation for email and password fields
```

In this example, the type is "feat" (a new feature), the scope is "login-page" and the subject is "added input validation for email and password fields". This commit message makes it clear that a new feature was added to the

login page, specifically input validation for the email and password fields.

The scope is an optional field, but it can be helpful in specifying the area of the codebase that the commit affects. This can be a specific module, file, or even a broader concept like "frontend" or "backend".

It's also important to note that the subject should be written in the present tense, and the first letter should be capitalized.

By following the conventional commit strategy, it's possible to use tools like **`semantic-release`** to automate tasks such as versioning and generating a change log.

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(login-page): added input validation for email and password fields"
git push
```

In this example, the commit message follows the conventional commit format and is pushed to the remote repository. A semantic-release tool could then use the commit message to automatically determine the next version number, and generate a change log.

It's important to note that the conventional commit strategy is not a hard requirement, but following it can make it easier to understand the history of a codebase, automate certain tasks and ensure consistency in your commits.

## **Conclusion**

Conventional commits are a structured way of writing commit messages that makes it easy to understand the history of a codebase and automate certain tasks such as versioning and changelog generation. By following the conventional commit format, you can make your commits more readable, and understandable and help your team to collaborate more efficiently.
Remember that the conventional commit strategy is not a hard requirement, but it can help to ensure consistency in your commits and make it easier to understand the history of a codebase.
